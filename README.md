# AzureDevOpsInsightsDashboard
This project is an end-to-end demo of a complete CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps. It features a React.js dashboard that visualizes data from Azure DevOps, demonstrating how to automate the build, test, and deployment process from commit to an Azure App Service. It's a hands-on guide for learning key DevOps practices.
